## Instructions

- As a guest you can visit the first video in the path of your choosing.

- Once you have saved some Paths, or started one, you will be taken to a classroom page where a modal will give you some more instructions on how to navigate the classroom page. 

- In the classroom you will be shown a video and have an coding editor presented to you.

   2.The editor to work in. 

   3.A browser like windwow that has a play button and 2 tabs.
